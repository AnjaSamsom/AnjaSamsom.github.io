                &emsp;Outside of my involvement on campus, I love to spend my time with my friends and family doing fun activities, especially 
                playing board games. Some other notable things that I enjoy are going on walks, listening to music, cooking, programming 
                (my favorite languages are C++ and Python), solving math perplexors, talking to people, and cleaning my room but only on days 
                that I really want to clean my room. I also love the Echo science museum (and any science/natural history museum) and pickled 
                onions and cabbage. I also really really love Taylor Swift and Star Wars.

                &emsp;<b>Hi! I'm Anja</b> and welcome to my website! I am a senior at the University of Vermont (UVM) studying Computer Science & 
                Informtation Systems in the College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences and the Honors College. Growing up, I lived
                in Montpelier, VT, the capital of Vermont, but I am now located in Burlington, VT for school!
            </p>

            <p>
                &emsp;SWiCS works to create a more inclusive environment on UVM's campus for women and non-binary students in computer
                science. As a club, we've done some really cool things! Some of my favorites that I've lead have been creating 
                and fundraising for a $5,000 scholarship for female and non-binary CS students at UVM, writing a grant and 
                receiving $16,000 in funding to send 8 students to the Women of Silicon Valley Conference in San Francisco,
                and co-operating with local high schools and tech businesses to bridge the gap between younger girls interested 
                in tech, to college aged people, to professionals in the computer science, tech, and engineering fields! 
                One of the thing's I'll miss most about UVM is the community that we've been able to find and build through
                SWiCS and I hope this is something I can find in a future job! But this website isn't about SWiCS, it's about
                me! <b><a href="https://swics.w3.uvm.edu/">But you can find the SWiCS website here...</a></b>
