            <p> &emsp;Fast forward two years and Maya's on to grad school, so I've taken over the president slot! SWiCS works to create a more inclusive
                environment on UVM's campus for women in computer science. As a club, we've done some really cool things! Some of my
                favorites that I've lead have been creating fundraising for $5,000 scholarship for female and non-binary CS students at UVM, 
                writing a grant and receiving $16,000 in funding to send 8 students to the Women of Silicon Valley Conference in San Francisco,
                and co-operating with local high schools and tech businesses to bridge the gap between younger girls interested in tech, to colleged 
                aged people, to professionals in the computer science, tech, and engineering fields! One of the thing's I'll miss most about UVM is the community
                that we've been able to find and build through SWiCS and I hope this is something I can find in a future job! But this website isn't about
                SWiCS, it's about me! <b><a href="https://swics.w3.uvm.edu/">But you can find the SWiCS website here...</a></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;I also love being with my friends, I feel like I have fallen into being the person surrounded by the most amazing friends
                that have ever existed in the world. Spending time with them makes me so happy, so whether we are sitting at lunch
                or traveling to somewhere exciting, any day is the best day!
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;Some other noteable things that I enjoy are going on walks, listening to music, cooking, programming (my favorite
                languages are C++ and Python), playing board games, solving math perplexors, talking to people, and cleaning my room
                but only on days that I really want to clean my room. I also love the Echo science museum (and any science/natural history
                museum) and pickeled onions and cabbage. I also really really love Taylor Swift and Star Wars.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;So thank you so much for reading this slightly long intro into who I am! This website is partly for me to have
                because it's fun, but also to document everything I've done in my academic career. But I thought that could get a little
                dry so why not add some cool colors and tidbits about myself in here! Please check out my 
                <b><a href="https://anjasamsom.me/news">"In the News"</a></b> tab for every time I've been in any sort of newspaper or 
                magazine and my <b><a href="https://anjasamsom.me/resume">"Resume"</a></b> tab to see my resume!
                Have a great day!

            <p>
                &emsp;<b>Hi! I'm Anja</b> and welcome to my website! I am a senior at the University of Vermont (UVM) studying Computer Science & 
                Informtation Systems in the College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences and the Honors College. Growing up, I lived
                in Montpelier, VT, the capital of Vermont, but I am now located in Burlington, VT for school!
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;I've always been the type of person who loves school, I love sitting down and doing homework projects, sometimes
                the most exciting things is when you finally are able to turn in a project that brought you on such a journey! So 
                in most of my free time, I find myself doing some sort of activity or working on a project. It's hard for me 
                to do nothing, I'm actually writing this on vacation because I'm kind of needing to do something slightly brain worky (
                    don't get me wrong, this is a wonderful vacation, I'm just quite excited for school to start and to get into the swing
                    of a schedule again haha).
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;So, all that being said, outside of classes, I like to do other school related things. My favorite being my time
                spent as the president of the Society of Women in Computer Science (or SWiCS) at UVM. When I arrived on campus sophomore year
                after my year at home due to the pandemic, I ended up joining SWiCS, which was working on rising from the ashes
                of inactivity with the guidance of my friend Maya. I quickly asked her if I could help and ended up becoming vice president.
