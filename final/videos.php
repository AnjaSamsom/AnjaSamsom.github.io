            <p class="text">A special video to celebrate the best holiday, Valentine's Day! Watch to see a rabies PSA, poetry reading, get your
                questions answered by the love expert, and to watch a cooking video go horribly wrong! There are many instances of mild almost nudity
                so be warned before you watch. The Valentine's Day Special marks a new type of video for UVM TV, the collaborative special. This
                video was made by contracting out segments to different members of the club who each wrote, filmed, and edited their own segments.
                Those videos were then sent back to the main editor, Max Kriff, who put the whole video together!
