        <p class="text">Founded in 2001, UVM TV is UVM's student run television station! While we originally had a cable tv station, we
            now post our content on YouTube and Instagram! We film short films, interviews,
            both fiction and non-fiction series, and promotional videos for other clubs!
            Our members learn about filming, editing, and production through our meetings and are a variety of film and non-film related majors.
            We also run events like the 2021 Green and Golden Globes, a short film festival for UVM students both in the club 
            and outside the club. Selling out our venue, we had almost 100 people in the audience and honored several short films!

                "I joined UVM TV on a whim because I signed up for so many clubs at the club fair!
                I was looking through my email one afternoon and saw that they were casting for 'The Weregator' a few hours from then!
                I signed up for auditions and walked on over to the Studio and that was the best decision I ever made! Filming the movie was
                so fun and the people I met through the club are some of the coolest people ever! They even helped me make my own show!"
